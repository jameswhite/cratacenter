<p>I like to use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-Power-Switch-Pro-Model/dp/B0765NCB2L">Web Power Swiitch</a> whenever I cable up things to power. It has a rudimentary ping capability that can power cycle a port if it loses network connectivity to it. A handy feature if you're not going to have physical access to a machine that might be having network problems and just needs a reboot to get it going again. Getting the power cables all shoved out of the way without restricting air flow too much is a challenge.</p><br>

<p>For the network, I like to color code my cables for which traffic the port will be carrying. It costs a little more finding the right color cable in the right length, but it saves me headaches when I'm trying to figure out things in a hurry. I wire them close to the physical location for the APU4 boards, and the top and bottom switches will be configured identically, so that should a switch fail, the cables in one can be moved to the same port on the other switch. This means only 50% of the ports on either switch will be in use when both switches are functional. This also means a single switch must have enough ports to handle all devices in the crate. We lose some efficiency here for the redundancy.</p>
<li>1 port for the deployer node</li>
<li>1 port for the Web Power Switch</li>
<li>1 port the WAN uplink</li>
<li>1 port the LAN uplink</li>
<li>2 ports for the uplinks</li>
<li>4 ports for the NAS</li>
<li>4 ports for each of the two APU4 boards</li>
<li>15 ports for the 3 esx servers (each one has 4 NICs and an ILO NIC)</li>
<li>1 port to uplink to another cratacenter for storage migrations</li>
<p>This exhausts around 32 ports, leaving 16 ports for whatever we might imagine later. This is why 48-port switches were chosed instead of 24 port ones.</p>

<p>For the serial port setup, you'll need:</p><br>
<li>A seven port USB hub</li>
<li>5 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GRP8EZU">USB to Serial RS232 Adapter - Prolific PL-2303</a></li>
<li>3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KLBEAM">Serial RS232 DB9 Null Modem Cables</a> (or straight through cables with null-modem adapters if you have them lying around</li>
<li>2 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S2KPPU">Cisco 72-3383-01 RJ-45 to DB-9 Rollover Console Cables</a></li>
<p>I cabled the cisco rollover cables to the edge switches, and the null-modem cables to the NAS, and the consoles on the two APU4s. Then plugged the USB side into the 7 port USB switch, and used the last two ports to power the raspberry pi and the monitor from the Kano.me kit.</p>

<p>At this point everything is connected and ready to lay out operating systems and configure with our deployment node.</p>
